# MXL Requirements 
Welcome to the Requirements repository of the MXL Project. 

Currently, two types of issues can be found in this repository: those starting with [RC], which are intended for discussion at the weekly Requirements Council meeting, and those starting with [REQ], which represent formal Requirements for the DMF-MXL Project.
